### Content insights
Sass is a scripting language that extends the capabilities of CSS. It adds extra features to CSS, making it easier   
to write and maintain CSS sheets. If your style sheet has too many seperated selectors, Using Sass you can nest   
them together for better organization and structure.   
Variables and mixins is Sass allowed me to define and reuse styles throughout the stylesheet. Instead of going through   
every selector to change a colour, I was able to make changes in a single place and use Mixin and @include to   
reuse it for different selectors.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Up until now I have been using CSS styles sheets by itself but after learning how to use Sass I felt that it was an   
essential part of styling a site. Not only did it save time, it also made it easier to read and write css.   
I feel that I have improved my CSS writing skills as well as html structure due to Scss.   
For a web developer, CSS is an essential skill and Scss takes it one step further increasing my chances of employability.
