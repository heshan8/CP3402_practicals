### Content insights
PHP is a server-side scripting language. It allows you to work with HTML to create dynamic web pages.   
Using an HTML file directly is much less resource intensive compared to using a similar file written in PHP.  
I learnt that php has extensive database support, such ass MYSQL for seamless database integration.   
I also learnt that PHP ise server-side exclusively, and it never sent to a clients web browser.    
Rather than re-writing HTML code in backend for each web page, using PHP to write a general template is more efficient.  

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Learning a new language quickly is difficult, but I was able to use my previous experience with Python and HTML to make   
it easier. PHP is widely used language in the industry, and it is a near essential skill to have as a web developer.   
It was interesting to see the backend workings of a dynamic website and if I decide to pursue web development   
in the future, it will be an essential part of my career.
