### Content insights
I learned that Local hosting is a good way to test your site before going live. Hosting locally requires you to do 
everything manually, and it can be difficult. Local hosting is more efficient for development compared to cloud hosting
due to it being hosted locally and not inquiring a fast network connection. 

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Local hosting is actively used in the industry to develop and test websites more efficiently. 
Having local hosting experience will help with any career built around web design and backend development.
I found hosting local to be more difficult and less efficient.
