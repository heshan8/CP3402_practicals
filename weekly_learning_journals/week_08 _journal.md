### Estimated hours
Around 5 hours.

### Content insights
Using a completed template can be easier at times but using a custom theme allows you to create a site that is more   
for your needs. Creating a custom theme is more flexible and can evolve with your project.   
I researched ways to improve my learning ability and decided to use 10-15 minute study breaks which I have been putting   
off for a while. I learned that taking breaks can improve you brain activity which can improve yor productivity.   

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
While watching lecture content I took small breaks but at first did not see a noticeable difference.   
During breaks, I found myself watching social media, tv or YouTube and I figured this was negating the purpose of   
taking breaks. Instead, I started doing small stretches, listening to music, and cleaning up. This increased my   
learning hours and I noticed a small difference. I was able to focus more and remember things better. I also felt less   
stressed and stopped me from getting bored too quickly. I can apply this in a future career to improve my employability   
and be more productive in a workplace.
