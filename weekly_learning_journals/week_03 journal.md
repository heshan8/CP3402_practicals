### Estimated hours
I spent around 10 hours watching lecture content, other useful videos on linked in and working on WordPress Site.

### Content insights
Using WordPress was a much better experience compared to joomla. The site was a lot more stable and easier to set up.
Watching linked in learning videos was very helpful in getting started with WordPress. I was able to learn some useful
things such as the difference between wordpress.com and .org and the difference between a post and a page.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
As someone with little to no experience in cms, WordPress is one of the best CMS programs out there, and it is widely
used. While looking for jobs, I have seen employers asking for experience with WordPress a number of times and
If I start a career in web design I'll have no issues with using WordPress.
