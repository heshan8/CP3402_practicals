### Content insights
Joomla was a decent intro to CMS. As this is my first experience with CMS It helped me to understand the basics of CMS
and how usefully it is for managing websites more efficiently.


### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The team-forming "job interview" process was a great way to experience job interview similar to real life.
Questions about Organizing skills, Availability and Experience in CMS were frequently Asked. These are very important
questions that will almost always get asked in real life job interviews.

Joomla CMS is quite old and can get confusing at first. It feels clunky at times and difficult to use.
In a real job it would not be my first choice of CMS as far better ones exist such as WordPress and Drupal, but 
depending on my carer it is good practice to have a wide-ranging knowledge of different CMS to maximise employability.
