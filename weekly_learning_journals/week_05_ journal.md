### Estimated hours
Around 4 hours.

### Content insights
A Child theme allows you to make styling and functional changes to your site without changing the parent theme.  
I learnt that a child theme is seperated from the parent theme which saves time and makes it portable.  
Child themes stops changes from being lost in the main theme if there is an update for the main theme.
Child themes are easy to make is it only needs a .css file to get started.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Child themes are extensively used in the industry to save time by not re-inventing the wheel.  
Experience in working with child themes is essential for a career in web design.  
If I decide to pursue web design as a career this will be extremely usefully.  
Watching tutorials and learning videos got boring quickly. Watching and working on a task at the same time 
proved to be more productive for me.
